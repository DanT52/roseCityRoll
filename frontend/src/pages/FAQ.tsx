      question: "What are the difficulty ratings?",
      answer: "We use a difficulty system:\n\n" +
        "ðŸŸ¢ Green: 6-7 mph, rougher surfaces, some hills\n" +
        "ðŸ”µ Blue: 8-10 mph, moderate terrain, hills up to 25 mph\n" +
        "âš« Black: 10-12+ mph, challenging terrain, steep hills"
    },
    {
      id: '4',
      question: "How experienced of a skater do I need to be?",
      answer: "Each day's routes will be marked with difficulty ratings so you can choose what's best for you based on your personal fitness and skill level. Portland is geographically a hilly city so speed control and stopping techniques are needed to be safe. We will occasionally be skating amongst traffic so urban awareness is essential. We'll try to maintain an average pace of 7-8 mph. There will be regroup points and longer breaks every hour or so. Each ride usually follows the following pattern: A mellow uphill for 3-5 miles inland from sea level. Flatter streets for most of the skate, and a descent back to sea level.\n\nYou can also checkout the exact routes we will be skating by checking out the \"Route Map\" tab within each event on the Schedule page. This will give you a better idea of the elevation profiles, terrain, and hazards."
